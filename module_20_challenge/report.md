## Overview of the Analysis

For this analysis, the goal was to predict if we could determine if the loan was high-risk or healthy using other variables. I used LogisticRegression model to observe the data and look at healthy vs high-risk loans.

## Results

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * healthy loans precision 1.0
  *high-risk loans precision 0.85
  *model 1 balanced accuracy score 0.95
  *healthy loan recall 0.99
  *high-risk loan recall 0.91

* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * model 2 balanced accuracy 0.99
  *healthy loan precision 1.0
  *high-risk loan precision 0.84
  *healthy loan recall 0.99
  *high-risk loan recall 0.99

## Summary
 
I believe Model 2 is the best model to use because the recall for the loans are higher. The precision for the loans are basically the same so I went off the recall numbers. The high-risk recall number allows us to see that there are very few loans that are high-risk when they are classified as healthy. So it is more accurate for us and the customers.
